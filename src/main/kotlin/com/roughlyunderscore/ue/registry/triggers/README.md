# Triggers
Triggers are what activates the enchantments in the first place. They are well described in the [users' guide for triggers](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/users/enchantments.html#trigger) and the [documentation for creating triggers](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/devs/creating_triggers.html).

# Triggers roadmap
- [ ] Make a way for handling effect-based enchantments better (e.g. do an action on equipping an item with an enchantment and on unequipping)
