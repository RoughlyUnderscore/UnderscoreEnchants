# Conditions
Actions are what happens when an enchantment gets activated. They are well described in the [users' guide for actions](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/users/enchantments.html#actions) and the [documentation for creating actions](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/devs/creating_actions.html).

# Actions roadmap
- [ ] Add a shared `"actions"` field for all levels (happens independently of the level that gets activated)
