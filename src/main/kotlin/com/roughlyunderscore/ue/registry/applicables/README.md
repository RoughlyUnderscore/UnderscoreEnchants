# Applicables
Applicables are used to define the items which can be legally enchanted. They are well described in the [users' guide for applicables](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/users/enchantments.html#applicables) and the [documentation for creating applicables](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/devs/creating_applicables.html).
