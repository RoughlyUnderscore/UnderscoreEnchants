# Placeholders
Placeholders are dynamic information that can be used in the arguments of actions and conditions and get replaced when an enchantment gets activated. They are well described in the [users' guide for placeholders](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/users/tips_and_tricks.html) and the [documentation for creating placeholders](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/devs/creating_placeholders.html).
