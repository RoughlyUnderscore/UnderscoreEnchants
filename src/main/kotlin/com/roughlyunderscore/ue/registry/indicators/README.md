# Activation indicators
Activation indicators, or just indicators, are various ways of informing the player that the enchantment has been activated. They are well described in the [users' guide for indicators](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/users/enchantments.html#activation_indicators) and the [documentation for creating conditions](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/devs/creating_indicators.html).
