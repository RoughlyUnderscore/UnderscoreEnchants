# Conditions
Conditions are used to determine whether the enchantment should be triggered. They are well described in the [users' guide for conditions](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/users/enchantments.html#conditions) and the [documentation for creating conditions](https://ue.runderscore.com/docs/devs/creating_conditions.html).

# Conditions roadmap
- [x] Implement comparison of any two values (e.g., placeholder against number)
- [ ] `optional` field that accepts a boolean and specifies whether the condition is optional (defaults to `false`)
- [x] A condition field for actions
