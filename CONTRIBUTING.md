How to contribute
===
Once again, thanks for being with us! If you are here to contribute any code, extra documentation, or anything else, this paragraph is for you.

### Expectations
You should not be contributing if you have nothing to bring to the table. Here are the general guidelines:

#### What's not welcome
Contributions that...
* only focus on fixing code style;
* only optimize something;
* only add unit tests
  are **not welcome**.

In addition, contributions that largely refactor a big part of the code just for the sake of structuring are **frowned upon, but not forbidden**. However, care to document the new code structure in the commit message for it to have a chance to be accepted.

#### What's welcome
Contributions that...
* fix bugs;
* add/fix implementations for API methods;
* add features
  are **welcome**.

#### What should every contribution have

1) The added code must be tested.
2) The code should be reasonably optimized.

### Creating a PR
This project relies on the Git VCS for convenience. As such, you're expected to be familiar with it and how to create PRs.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is

```
### Commit message
A commit message must be fairly small, yet informative.
1) The first line should be the general commit idea.
2) The second line should be left empty.
3) Everything else should be wrapped to not be longer than 90 characters - if it is, put it on a new line (except for URLs).
4) If the commit message has any general links or such information (such as "References"), they should be put on the last lines.

Example of a good commit message:
```
sum: Adding a new trigger

A new trigger, "PLAYERLEAVEBED", has been added. This will allow for users detect
players leaving their beds. Can be useful for some armor enchantments.
Aliases:
- PLAYERLEAVEBED
- PLAYERBEDLEAVE
- WAKEUP
- PLAYERWAKEUP
- GETUP
- PLAYERGETUP

Reference: issue #52 (request: add player leave bed)
```

How to suggest a feature
===
Suggesting features is also contribution in a way! That said, there are some guidelines for suggesting features.
### Where to suggest features
You can suggest features in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RoughlyUnderscore/UnderscoreEnchants/issues). If you do not feel like it,
you are always welcome to write at #suggestions in my [Support Discord server](https://discord.gg/bBge7bj3ra).
### A good feature suggestion
What makes a good feature suggestion is the research behind it.
1) Make sure that there's no (recent) issue already open on that topic.
2) If you're going to use Discord, take a look at the last couple messages in #suggestions, because maybe such feature has been proposed recently.
3) Really make sure that the feature isn't already there. For example, there's no reason for an "expect-all-fail" condition flag, because conditions
   can be negated.

How to report a bug
===
If it's a minor bug, report it in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RoughlyUnderscore/UnderscoreEnchants/issues). However, if it's a major exploitable
bug or a security exploit, refrain from using issues, and instead open a ticket in my [Support Discord server](https://discord.gg/bBge7bj3ra). 

Before opening
an issue, please also make sure that there's no (recent) issue already open on that bug.

Code styling
===
Are you ready to make your first contribution to UnderscoreEnchants? Well then, have at it! While writing code, please make sure to follow some code styling code guidelines.

1) UnderscoreEnchants code is [K&R-styled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style). There are some minor adjustments:
```kotlin
// For short one-line expressions, this is acceptable, but not preferred
if (1 == 2)
  return

// Instead, this is preferred
if (1 == 2) return

// However, for long one-line expressions, this is acceptable, but not preferred
if (1 == 2) bake().cook().doSomethingElse().extraLong().maybe().optional().veryLongMethod()

// Instead, this is preferred
if (1 == 2)
  bake().cook().doSomethingElse().extraLong().maybe().optional().veryLongMethod()
```

2) Not every single method should be documented, but if the name isn't clear enough, it should be. Moreover, any method in a utility class (such as DataUtils) should be documented.
3) The code indentation is **2 spaces** for Kotlin.
4) Please annotate your utility methods as follows (annotations from ULib):
```kotlin
// For stable methods
@Since("YYYY-mm-dd") // The date of your pull request
@Stable

// For unstable methods
@Since("YYYY-mm-dd")
@Beta
```

Join the development team

As of update 2.2, the plugin is developed solely by RoughlyUnderscore. As such, if you're ready to dedicate time and patience to this project, contact me via a ticket
in my [support Discord server](https://discord.gg/bBge7bj3ra) and we'll figure something out.
